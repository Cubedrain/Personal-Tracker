# Bugs Present

1. Music handler in the modal currently skips the clicked audio music heading for the previous one.
2. Storage means of the current time lapsed in the pomo timer is faulty, make sure to stay in the pomo tab in order to retain the time taken for tracking of performance.

# Extra tips

Since the application will be replicated in mobile devices, responsiveness has been ignored on smaller devices but will be added later on and animations as well shall be added.
